ALGORITHM USED FOR SEAT ALLOTMENT:

1. FOR EACH INCOMING CUSTOMER ORDER, WE CHECK AGAINST THE LIST OF SECTIONS.

2. IF THE ORDER REQUIRES EXACT NUMBER OF SEATS THAT THE SECTION HAS, WE ALLOT THAT SECTION TO THAT PARTICULAR CUSTOMER

3. IF THE ORDER REQUIRES SEATS THAT'S MORE THAN THE THEATRE CAPACITY, WE SIMPLY SAVE THE STATUS OF THE ORDER TO "WE CANNOT HANDLE YOUR PARTY"

4. IF THE ORDER REQUIRES SEATS THAT'S LESS THAN THE REMAINING SEATS IN THE SECTION, THEN WE CHECK IF WE CAN FIND ANY OTHER ORDER WITH THE DEFICIT NUMBER OF SEATS, SO THAT WE CAN PROCESS BOTH THE ORDERS

5. IF IN STEP-4, WE DIDNOT FIND AN ORDER WITH THE DEFICIT SEATS, WE TRY TO FIND OTHER SECTION WITH AVAILABLE SEATS

6. IF IN STEP-5, IF WE FOUND THE SECTION, WE SIMPLY ALLOT THAT SECTION TO THE CUSTOMER ORDER

7. IF IN STEP-5, IF WE DIDNOT FIND THE SECTION, WE SIMPLY ALLOT THOSE SEATS IN THE CURRENT SECTION

8. WE CHECK AT THE BEGINNING OF EVERY ITERATION, IF THE STATUS OF THE ORDER IS NOT SET, THEN ONLY PROCESS, OTHERWISE PROCEED TO NEXT ORDER
